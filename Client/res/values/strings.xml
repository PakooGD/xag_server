2. The system will automatically return the device you borrowed and retrieve the device you lent before migration. Please ensure that the devices are not in operation during migration.
3. After the migration is completed, HD maps stored in your phone can be viewed and used normally; HD maps stored in the cloud will not be able to be viewed and used. You can contact customer service to get your cloud HD maps, and then continue use by importing local HD maps.
4. If you are the team leader, the team data will migrate with you to the new server, and the team members can no longer access the team for mapping and operations; if you are a team member and migrate to a server different from the team's, you will not be able to continue using the team for mapping and operations. Please contact the team members promptly to migrate to the same server to continue using the team data.
5. After the migration is completed, you will not be able to log in to other XAG platforms, including but not limited to XAG Agri App, XAG XPliot App, XAG AutoPilot App, etc.
